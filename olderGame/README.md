APPROACH:

I used multiple constructor functions in order to inact the main actions within my blackjack application; to build cards within the deck, to build the the decks within the shoe, to shuffle the decks. I also separated the dealer from the player when it came to enacting their functionalities.

 In the DOM I tried to call on my methods based off of how it would take place logically during real game play. I used event listeners to call actions within my JS files instead of hard coding them into the HTML. I also created if/else statements for the winning conditions. As well, I added alert messages so there was more interaction between the player and the app.

 Installation: Ideally, you'd put your bet into the box and then place it by clicking the 'bet' button. Depending on card values the player would either click 'hit', to add another card to their hand or click 'stay', if they are happy with their hand.

 There is also a deal card that would clear the board and deal out a new hand from the dealer.

 The process of the game would repeat itself until the player had completed the game. 

Unsolved Problems: I would have loved to have more time on the project in general. I found myself worrying too much about issues that were essentially superfluous while not allocating enough time on other issues. The game itself still has issues working properly due to an error.

I would've like to display the dealer values before dealing out a new hand. I would've liked to spend more time on styling, added images to the cards, and added a face down card.

Also, if I had a chance I would've kept the original way I had attempted to enact my methods. Having buttons in the HTML that I enacted through cache selectors in the JS. I changed this up to handle every method straight from the DOM and I think the time spent in that hurt me more than anything else. In the end, I think it was the lack of confidence in my own code that caused me to start over. I won't make that mistake again.

Overall, the process showed me how invaluable user stories could've been had I used them to their fullest potential.
