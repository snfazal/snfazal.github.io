Project 1: Blackjack


Summary:

I decided to go with blackjack over connect four. Not very familiar with either game, I made my decision based off of operational weaknesses that I wanted to become stronger in over our break. Object Oriented Programming has been a struggle for me since day one and so I really wanted to take the opportunity to practice this type of application management during a build out phase.

The skill level involved in executing an OOP design was blatant after I begin the project. I was proud to be able to get function capability even though the struggle was so real that I wasn't able to put much thought into html and css. I would've loved to spend more time on design and really make the application look like the user is playing blackjack at a casino; however, my motive was to complete all my functionality to the best of my ability first.

As of now, my game meets 5/6 MVPs for the project. The only MVP remaining is a reoccurring reflection of the bankroll so that the user is able to see an updated bankroll that reflects their score during gameplay. The bankroll does reflect the score of the first round; but after that I am unable to get it to reflect anything else. I am hoping to change this issue before presenting my game.
